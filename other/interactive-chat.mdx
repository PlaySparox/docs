## Chat Placeholders

All our game servers feature **Interactive Chat** which allows users to send messages with information such as their current balance, inventory or held item.

| Type         | Placeholder  | Result          |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Item         | [item]       | Sends a **hoverable** message which shows your held item's name, enchants and other related data. |
| Inventory    | [inv]        | Sends a **clickable** message which opens a GUI, showing all of your inventory items. |
| Money        | [money]      | Sends a **hoverable** message which shows your current balance |
| Coordinates  | [pos]        | Sends a **chat** message which shows your coordinates. |

## Player Mentioning

Additionally, you can mention players in-game which notifies them of your message.
You can do this by including a `@` before their name. (Example: *`Hey @MaxUK__, I've found Diamonds!`*).

<Tip>**Don't want to be mentioned?** You can disable all chat mentions with `/ic mentiontoggle`.</Tip>
